#### **Initial Tasks**  
1. **Research & Setup**  
   - Audit Krita’s Storyboard Docker API and animation workflow ().  
   - Test local model integration (e.g., Stable Diffusion via `diffusers` library).  
   - Explore NVIDIA’s query injection paper () for cross-scene consistency.  

2. **Minimal Viable Prototype**  
   - Develop a basic UI panel in Krita for text-to-image generation.  
   - Implement seed locking and LoRA loading for character consistency ().  
   - Add a “batch generate” mode for sequential shots with shared features ().  

3. **Consistency Pipeline**  
   - Integrate LoRA training scripts for user-customized characters ().  
   - Adapt self-attention sharing from ConsiStory () for multi-shot coherence.  
   - Test with low-resolution proxies to reduce VRAM usage.  

4. **Optimization**  
   - Quantize models using ONNX or TensorRT for faster inference.  
   - Implement caching for frequently used prompts/characters.  

5. **Documentation & Testing**  
   - Write a user guide for non-technical animators.  
   - Validate with open-source animation communities (e.g., Krita Artists Forum).

### **Key Considerations**  
- **Open Source Compliance**: Avoid proprietary models; use community-trained LoRAs or Consistency Models ().  
- **Cost Efficiency**: Local models reduce API costs but require GPU optimization.  
- **Future-Proofing**: Design modular architecture to incorporate new techniques (e.g., NVidia’s Q-Flow ).
