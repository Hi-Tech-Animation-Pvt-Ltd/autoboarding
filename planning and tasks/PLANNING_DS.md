**Objective**: Develop an open-source Krita plugin to generate consistent storyboards using local AI models, optimized for non-technical animators.  

#### **High-Level Direction**  
1. **Integration with Krita**:  
   - Leverage Krita’s existing Storyboard Docker () for seamless workflow integration.  
   - Use Python scripting and Krita’s API to add AI-powered generation tools to the interface.  

2. **Consistency Mechanisms**:  
   - **Local Models**: Prioritize open-source models like Stable Diffusion with LoRA fine-tuning for character consistency ().  
   - **Feature Sharing**: Implement query injection strategies inspired by NVIDIA’s Video Storyboarding () to balance identity preservation and motion dynamics.  
   - **Seed Control**: Allow users to lock seeds for deterministic outputs, similar to DALL-E workflows ().  

3. **Efficiency & Cost**:  
   - Use quantized or distilled models (e.g., Consistency Models ) for single-step generation, reducing GPU memory usage.  
   - Optimize for CPU/GPU hybrid inference to support low-resource devices.  

4. **Scope**:  
   - Phase 1: Single-image generation with character/style consistency.  
   - Phase 2: Multi-shot sequence generation using temporal attention ().  
   - Phase 3: Export to Krita’s animation timeline () and PDF/SVG storyboards ().  

#### **Tech Stack**  
- **Backend**: Python, PyTorch, ONNX Runtime (for model optimization).  
- **Models**: Stable Diffusion + LoRA, Consistency Models (distillation), NVIDIA’s Video Storyboarding techniques.  
- **UI**: Qt for Krita plugin integration, Gradio for local model testing.  
- **Open Source**: MIT License; dependencies on Hugging Face Transformers, Diffusers.
